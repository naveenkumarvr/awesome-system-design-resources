## 📌 System Design Key Concepts

| Concept | Relevance | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Scalability | Essential | Core for designing scalable CI/CD, Kubernetes, and infrastructure systems. |
| Availability | Essential | Design for high availability across regions, clusters, and services. |
| CAP Theorem | Essential | Helps balance consistency and availability in distributed systems. |
| ACID Transactions | Intermediate | Important when dealing with DB reliability, but not primary focus. |
| Consistent Hashing | Essential | Used in load balancing, distributed caching, and service discovery. |
| Rate Limiting | Essential | Important for protecting APIs, ingress controllers, and ALBs. |
| SPOF (Single Point of Failure) | Essential | Identify and eliminate single points of failure in infrastructure. |
| Fault Tolerance | Essential | Design resilient infrastructure with Auto Healing and Multi-AZ setups. |
| Consensus Algorithms | Intermediate | Know conceptually; applies to etcd, Zookeeper, EKS control plane. |
| Gossip Protocol | Intermediate | Basics used in Consul, Cassandra, etc. |
| Service Discovery | Essential | Important for Kubernetes, ECS, or microservices infrastructure. |
| API Design | Intermediate | Know enough to architect gateways and manage routing. |
| Disaster Recovery | Essential | Must-have for multi-region failover and data replication. |
| Distributed Tracing | Essential | Core for observability (Jaeger, AWS X-Ray, OpenTelemetry). |

## 🛠️ System Design Building Blocks

| Concept | Relevance | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| CDN | Essential | Needed for web delivery optimization, CloudFront design, etc. |
| Proxy vs Reverse Proxy | Essential | Critical for load balancing (Nginx, Envoy, ALB). |
| DNS | Essential | Must understand Route53, private DNS, and latency routing. |
| Caching | Essential | For application acceleration and infrastructure optimization. |
| Caching Strategies | Essential | Especially for CI/CD or infra caching (builds, images). |
| Distributed Caching | Essential | How Redis/Memcached scale in distributed setups. |
| Load Balancing | Essential | Core — design ALB/NLB, API Gateway, service mesh balancing. |
| Databases Types | Essential | Know when to use RDS, DynamoDB, Elasticsearch, etc. |
| SQL vs NoSQL | Essential | Core decision for designing stateful app infrastructure. |
| Database Indexes | Intermediate | Relevant for performance tuning. |
| Consistency Patterns | Essential | Needed for cache/DB sync and data replication understanding. |
| HeartBeats | Intermediate | Important in monitoring and leader election systems. |
| Circuit Breaker | Essential | For fault-tolerant microservices and service mesh designs. |
| Idempotency | Essential | Needed in pipeline and retry-safe automation design. |
| Database Scaling | Essential | Understand vertical/horizontal scaling patterns. |
| Data Replication | Essential | Core for DR and high availability setups. |
| Data Redundancy | Essential | For fault tolerance and backups. |
| Database Sharding | Intermediate | Useful in distributed data store contexts. |
| Database Architectures | Intermediate | Know master-slave, multi-master, read-replica setups. |
| Failover | Essential | High priority — auto failover in clusters, databases, etc. |
| Bloom Filters | Intermediate | Not mandatory — used in cache/query optimization. |
| Message Queues | Essential | Core — SQS, Kafka, RabbitMQ for event-driven automation. |
| WebSockets | Intermediate | Know basics, less used in infra design. |
| Checksums | Essential | Important for data integrity in storage/migration pipelines. |
| API Gateway | Essential | Design routing, throttling, and security layers. |
| Microservices Guidelines | Essential | Must understand how infrastructure supports microservices. |
| Distributed Locking | Essential | For state management in distributed CI/CD or jobs. |

## ⚖️ System Design Tradeoffs

| Concept | Relevance | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Top 15 Tradeoffs | Essential | Tradeoffs occur in every architectural decision. |
| Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling | Essential | Foundational for cluster and system design. |
| Stateful vs Stateless Design | Essential | Must master for container, pod, and deployment design. |
| Batch vs Stream Processing | Essential | Relevant for CI/CD event handling and log pipelines. |
| Strong vs Eventual Consistency | Essential | Key for distributed infra (S3, DynamoDB, caches). |
| Read-Through vs Write-Through Cache | Essential | Helps design caching tiers and data refresh logic. |
| Push vs Pull Architecture | Intermediate | Applies to monitoring, log shipping, and CI triggers. |
| Long-polling vs WebSockets | Intermediate | Know conceptually, less used in infra design. |
| REST vs RPC | Essential | Understand integration choices for internal APIs. |
| Synchronous vs Asynchronous Communications | Essential | Must understand for pipeline orchestration. |
| Latency vs Throughput | Essential | Important for designing build and delivery pipelines. |

## 🖇️ System Design Architectural Patterns

| Architecture | Relevance | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| Client-Server Architecture | Essential | Foundation for any infrastructure design. |
| Microservices Architecture | Essential | You’ll design and deploy microservice platforms. |
| Serverless Architecture | Essential | Must know for Lambda, Fargate, EventBridge, etc. |
| Event-Driven Architecture | Essential | Core for modern CI/CD and alerting systems. |
| Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture | Intermediate | Rarely needed, but good to understand for distributed systems. |
